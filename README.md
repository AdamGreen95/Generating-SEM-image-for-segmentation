# Generating-SEM-image-for-segmentation
A classical interactive method for homogeneous nano-paritcle cluster image generation.

Due to a terrific effort to obtain labels for some certain types of medical images, it is understandable to use some codes to reduce workload. All codes are based on Matlab R2018a and are still in progress. For a more detailed discussion, please feel free to open an issue.

If we treat the core part of flowchat as a module, the input of the module is a homogeneous cluster SEM image, while outputs are the synthesised iamge and its label.
